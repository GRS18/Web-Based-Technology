      India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. It is
      the seventh-largest country in the world by area and the most populous
      country. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the
      southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders
      with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and
      Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the
      vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands
      share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.
